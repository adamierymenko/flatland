Building Flatland on:

*** MacOSX:

Make sure you have the developer tools installed, and type:

make -f Makefile.MacOSX

It will build a binary for all four architectures: PPC32, PPC64,
x86-32, and x86-64.

*** Linux:

Install the GNU C++ compiler and the OpenGL and GLUT libaries and their
header files. On most Debian/Ubuntu systems, you can type:

apt-get install libglut-dev

On other systems you might have to use different package managers, or
the GLUT package might have a different name.

Then, type:

make -f Makefile.Linux

*** Windows (32-bit):

For convenience, I've included an already-built Windows binary in the
win32 directory since building on Windows is always harder than on other
platforms. You'll need to put the glut32.dll file packaged with it
at some standard DLL location on your system or in the same directory
that you place flatland.exe.

I've only built Flatland using the MinGW package available here:

http://nuwen.net/mingw.html

In addition, the GLUT library compiled for linking with MinGW is included
with the Flatland distro under the win32/ subdirectory. The make file for
win32 is already set up to reference this. So, just type:

make -f Makefile.Windows-MinGW

*** Windows (64-bit):

No directions here yet... if you get it to build here let me know!
